title: "⚡ Why Next.JS"

So last week I was once on a blog it looked very fast. I thought oh it must be just a static webpage build using Gatsby.
I checked [Wappalyzer Extenstion](https://www.wappalyzer.com/), and it was NextJS. It piqued my interest.

So, I started looking for blogs to learn and end up reading NextJS official docs and man the documentation for NextJS is some of the best I have ever come across. It has an interactive introduction that quizzes you as you go through the content to make sure you are following along 👏🏻.

Created this blog while learning NextJS.
If you know React/Angular/Vue you can easily relate things and learn quickly.

I later realized recently that for my recent [E-commerce](https://github.com/only-2/Ecommerce-app) app project, NextJS was more suitable over React.
Will move that project to NextJS someday.

Also in NextJS, you have more freedom with how you access your data.

GatsbyJS is also very amazing if you haven't explored it yet. Gatsby comes with some "starter" templates and "themes" which all make getting a fully functioning web app up and running a quick process.

👋🏻 See you next time.
